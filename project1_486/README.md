This project is comparing the percentages of UFO sightings to haunted spaces in Maryland counties. Counties with bigfoot sightings are also displayed on the map. </p>
The data used were created by Tim Renner, who took information from different internet sites and created cooresponding geospatial data. His files can be found <a href="https://data.world/timothyrenner">here</a>. </p>
I subsetted the data to Maryland, as the files included points all over the United States. </p>
I ran the Count Points by Polygon tool on each set of data to get a point count per county. Then, I found what percentage of points were in each county in order to standardize the counts (there were almost 10x more UFO sightings than haunted spaces.) I then displayed the results showing which counties have a higher percentage of UFO sightings or haunted spaces. I also displayed which counties had bigfoot sightings - there were only a few sightings in a few different counties.  </p>
In the final map, green shows counties with a higher percentage of UFO sightings, purple shows counties with a higher percentage of haunted spaces, white shows an equal percentage of both, and black hashing shows counties with bigfoot sightings.
