This project is looking at the spatial correlation of haunted spaces, UFO sightings, and bigfoot sightings to cities in Maryland. </p>
The data used were created by Tim Renner, who took information from different internet sites and created cooresponding geospatial data. His files can be found <a href="https://data.world/timothyrenner">here</a>. </p>
I subsetted the data to Maryland, as the files included points all over the United States. </p>
To see if there is any spatial correlation of these points to cities, I will be creating heatmaps for each category of points and overlaying them to city centers. </p>
The final outputs will be interactive webmaps that allow the user to click on individual points and see information about the location/sighting. </p>
