For this project, I wanted to explore how historic redlining has affected the costs of living, specifically rent prices, in Baltimore City. I will also be looking at how the racial make-up of census block groups might be correlated to these factors. <br><br>
I used 2000 census block group data of average monthly contractual rent prices and racial population taken from NHGIS. The redlining data is from the Home Ownerâ€™s Land Corporation (HOLC). The redlining maps of the city that were originally produced in the 1930s have been converted into geospatial polygons. <br><br> 
My final output was created using jquery with leaflet and qgis2web. The interactive map shows census block groups with information about median rent price and black population, as well as areas that were historically redlined.
